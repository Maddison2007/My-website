        <h2>Game Description</h2>
        <p>
            America, 1899. The end of the Wild West era has begun. After a robbery goes badly wrong in the western town
            of Blackwater, Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang are forced to flee. With federal agents and the best
            bounty hunters in the nation massing on their heels, the gang must rob, steal and fight their way across the
            rugged heartland of America in order to survive. As deepening internal divisions threaten to tear the gang
            apart, Arthur must make a choice between his own ideals and loyalty to the gang who raised him.

        <h2>List...</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>graphics are incredible in this game, looking over the different areas of the map is just so nice. The snow section looks amazing, the frost, the footprints in the snow. All of it was just so real. The woods with the sun going through the trees and the grass waving in the wind is absolutely insane. Graphics is definetely a 5/5.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>The story is really good once you get passed the first chapter. Chapter 1 in my opinion was slow. However...</li>
            <li>technical performance...</li>
            <li>overall value...</li>
