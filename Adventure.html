            Set in the post-apocalyptic United States, the game tells the story of survivors Joel Miller and Ellie
            Williams as they work together to survive their westward journey across what remains of the country to find
            a possible cure for the modern fungal plague that has nearly decimated the entire human race.

                graphics are amazing. The style for the game really suits the world that the game is set in. Post
                apocalyptic wasteland with broken buildings and plants everywhere. The graphics with the environment and
                the different settings in the game like when your in buildings there are shadows, In the sunset hours
                the lighting is incredible. All in all the graphics are amazing.
            </li>
            <li>
                The story is my all time favourite game story. The story is focussed on emotions and making the player
                feel emotionally connected to the characters especially towards joel's big decision that he has to make.
                You can see the relationship between Joel and Ellie expand as the story goes which makes the cutscenes
                in the game so much more difficult to watch. I absolutely love the story for this game.
            </li>
            <li>
                The performance of the game is really good. There are very little bugs in this game. I have never
                experienced one of these as I play on playstation and it is a very looked after game from them however I
                have seen the reviews from the pc players and how it was quite buggy when it first came out on pc but I
                have heard that they have fixed it since then.
            </li>
            <li>
                overall I absolutely love this game. It is one of my all time favourite games to play because the story
                is so unique and exciting especially the first time playing. It is definitely one of those games I wish
                i could go back and play for the first time again. I highly recommend playing this game.

                Graphics are really really good. I was honestly so impressed when this game out and the way that it
                looked because it was just so cool to see. When flying on the Hipogriff it's so crazy because you can
                see shadows and reflections in the water if you go close enough. It's honestly just so cool.
            </li>
            <li>
                The story is quite fun, I haven't finished it yet because honestly its really nice to just fly around
                because it has a really nice open world aspect to this game. But the story is quite fun. It can
                sometimes be quite repetitive however I do really enjoy it. I do wish though that we could see some of
                the characters from the books and the movies although it is set before them so I do understand why we
                don't but thats just a personal preference.
            </li>
            <li>
                The performance of the game is really good. I havent come across much lag or unexpected kicks from the
                game which is really good.
            </li>
            <li>
                Overall I do really like this game however I did fall out of playing it for a while and haven't been
                able to finish it but I am desperate to finish the story. I recomment this game to people who love the
                books and the movies because the fact you can cast spells and go on your own journeys is really fun.
