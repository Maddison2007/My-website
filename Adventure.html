        <h2>Game Description</h2>
        <p>
            Set in the post-apocalyptic United States, the game tells the story of survivors Joel Miller and Ellie
            Williams as they work together to survive their westward journey across what remains of the country to find
            a possible cure for the modern fungal plague that has nearly decimated the entire human race.

        <h2>The Last Of Us Review</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>graphics are amazing. The style for the game really suits the world that the game is set in. Post apocalyptic wasteland with broken buildings and plants everywhere. The graphics with the environment and the different settings in the game like when your in buildings there are shadows, In the sunset hours the lighting is incredible. All in all the graphics are amazing.</li>
            <li>The story is my all time favourite game story. The story is focussed on emotions and making the player feel emotionally connected to the characters especially towards joel's big decision that he has to make. You can see the relationship between Joel and Ellie expand as the story goes which makes the cutscenes in the game so much more difficult to watch. I absolutely love the story for this game.</li>
            <li>The performance of the game is really good. There are very little bugs in this game. I have never experienced one of these as I play on playstation and it is a very looked after game from them however I have seen the reviews from the pc players and how it was quite buggy when it first came out on pc but I have heard that they have fixed it since then.</li>
            <li>overall I absolutely love this game. It is one of my all time favourite games to play because the story is so unique and exciting especially the first time playing. It is definitely one of those games I wish i could go back and play for the first time again. I highly recommend playing this game.</li>
