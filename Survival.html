        <h2>Terraria Review</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The graphics for this game is exactly how you would expect a 2d game to look. I do have to say the colours when entering caves under ground and the underworld are extraordinary to look at. The regular overworld graphics are really nice, the colours and the environment are really pretty and makes it nice to play.</li>
            <li>I dont know much about the story but the basic knowledge is that you can use your own world however you want. You can build, you can fight or you can just run around taking care of your own house and farm. It is really up to you. I do like these kind of games where its not just about the story. I like it especially after a long day all you want is just to sit down and calmly explore the city you might have built. It is quite a nice concept.</li>
            <li>The game performance is quite good. I havent played much to actually find many bugs but I did some research and couldnt really find any big issues that people found just the usual small stuff that was fixed shortly afterwards which is good. The world background moves smoothly with your character which gives the illusion that your character is moving into different places around the map which I think is a nice touch to the game. </li>
            <li>overall I think the game is good. Its not something that I really play that often just because I dont play many 2d games and I do usually play minecraft when I want a chill game. I do recommend this game if you are the person that does like 2d games and games where you can do whatever and build whatever you desire.</li>
