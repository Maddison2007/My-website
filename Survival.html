        <h2>Terraria Review</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The graphics for this game is exactly how you would expect a 2d game to look. I do have to say the
                colours when entering caves under ground and the underworld are extraordinary to look at. The regular
                overworld graphics are really nice, the colours and the environment are really pretty and makes it nice
                to play.
            </li>
            <li>
                I dont know much about the story but the basic knowledge is that you can use your own world however you
                want. You can build, you can fight or you can just run around taking care of your own house and farm. It
                is really up to you. I do like these kind of games where its not just about the story. I like it
                especially after a long day all you want is just to sit down and calmly explore the city you might have
                built. It is quite a nice concept.
            </li>
            <li>
                The game performance is quite good. I havent played much to actually find many bugs but I did some
                research and couldnt really find any big issues that people found just the usual small stuff that was
                fixed shortly afterwards which is good. The world background moves smoothly with your character which
                gives the illusion that your character is moving into different places around the map which I think is a
                nice touch to the game.
            </li>
            <li>
                overall I think the game is good. Its not something that I really play that often just because I dont
                play many 2d games and I do usually play minecraft when I want a chill game. I do recommend this game if
                you are the person that does like 2d games and games where you can do whatever and build whatever you
                desire.

        <p>
            Minecraft is a game made up of blocks, creatures, and community. You can survive the night or build a work
            of art â€“ the choice is all yours. But if the thought of exploring a vast new world all on your own feels
            overwhelming, then fear not! Letâ€™s explore what Minecraft is all about!

        <h2>Minecraft Review</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The graphics are good due to the fact that everything in this game is made of cubes so the graphics are
                bound to be not the best but they are really good for what it is.
            </li>
            <li>
                There isnt really a story in minecraft, you kind of make your own story. The main aim of the game is to
                either "beat the game" which just includes killing the ender dragon however you can continue after that
                by expanding your world and defeating another boss called the wither and also getting all of the
                achievements in the game which is crazy (there is alot) either that or you can just do what I do and
                build anything you want. From a fortress, to a city or even maps from other games or movies. Its such an
                open concept which is amazing.
            </li>
            <li>
                The game performance is well questionable. Sometimes it can be really really good however unless you
                have a really good pc or decent console it can be quite laggy depending on what you are doing in the
                game so if you dont have a great pc or console expect it to be quite laggy when getting further into the
                game.
            </li>
            <li>
                Overall I love this game, I have played it on playstation, nintendo switch and pc. I love how open it
                is. You can choose what you do and you can have multiple worlds so if you want to do survival one day
                and creative the next you can. There is also different modes in survival like Peaceful, Easy, Normal,
                Hard and Hardcore which is where if you die your entire game gets whiped which ive never done but if
                your good at the game give that a try. I do absolutely recommend this game.
