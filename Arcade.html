        <h2>Game Description</h2>
        <p>
            The player competes in a series of one-on-one matches against a series of computer-controlled opponents or
            in a single match against another player. Each match is a series of rounds in which the player must defeat
            their opponent within 100 seconds. If a match ends before a fighter is knocked out, then the fighter with
            the greater amount of hit points left will be declared the round's winner. The player must win two rounds in
            order to defeat their opponent and proceed to the next battle. If the third round ends in a tie, then the
            computer-controlled opponent will win by default, or both players will lose. During the single-player mode,
            the player can continue after losing and fight against the opponent they lost the match with. Likewise, a
            second player can interrupt a single-player match and challenge the other player to a match.

        <h2>Street Fighter Review</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The graphics for this game are very retro as it is an older game and it is on an arcade machine but they are very simple graphics and I do love the retro graphics and how even the newer games are also retro which I think is just so cool that they are sticking with the original design.</li>
            <li>I don't really know the story for street fighter but overall it is very simple to understand. You can either play against another person or play against the machine. You select your character and you get transported to an arena where you fight the other player or machine until there is only one winner.</li>
            <li>The performance for the game is obviously not as good as the modern games we have now but for the time the game was released it was one of the best arcade games out there and one of the most popular. Along with pacman when you ask people name an arcade game these 2 are some answers you get alot. Depending on the machine some machines can have bugs which makes it more difficult to play however the game itself is not bug free. Sometimes there can be bugs but it is to be expected when playing the original game from quite a bit ago.</li>
            <li>overall I love the retro game style and how they have kept true to that throughout the making of the newer games. The game lost points for me just because you do get quite a few bugs on it compared to more modern games but whenever I go to an arcade this is definitely one of the games I always play because its so fun to compete against family and friends. I do recommend playing this next time your in an arcade.</li>
