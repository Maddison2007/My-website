        <h2>Game Description</h2>
        <p>
            The player competes in a series of one-on-one matches against a series of computer-controlled opponents or
            in a single match against another player. Each match is a series of rounds in which the player must defeat
            their opponent within 100 seconds. If a match ends before a fighter is knocked out, then the fighter with
            the greater amount of hit points left will be declared the round's winner. The player must win two rounds in
            order to defeat their opponent and proceed to the next battle. If the third round ends in a tie, then the
            computer-controlled opponent will win by default, or both players will lose. During the single-player mode,
            the player can continue after losing and fight against the opponent they lost the match with. Likewise, a
            second player can interrupt a single-player match and challenge the other player to a match.
